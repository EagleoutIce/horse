# A horse in TikZ

Horse on base in TikZ, generated during a train ride as a wing item for [tikzpingus](https://github.com/EagleoutIce?tab=repositories).

The example allows for free color customization. For an improved version with more color options and a design tweaked for scaling and other transformations, please see the aforementioned tikzpingus package (with the horse lib):
